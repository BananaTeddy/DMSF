# DMSF
Dem Max Sein Framework, or DMSF for short, is yet another small PHP framework, which was created by me to learn a bit of PHP programming.

You can use it if you really want to, but you're probably better off just using some existing and well known framework like Code Igniter, Symfony, Laravel, etc.
Those are better tested and probably more secure. You'll also get a lot more help on the internet. Well... I guess anything is more help than zero help at all.
